Easy JS web-browser language detector & redirect script

Introduction
This script detects the user’s browser language and redirects them to the corresponding translated webpage.

How It Works?

Folder Structure:
Create folders for each language of your website. For example, en for English and de for German.
Each folder contains an index.html file with the translated version of your website.

Main Folder:
In the main folder, include a JavaScript file and an index.html file that links to the JavaScript.

Script Explanation

Script Functionality:
The script works by detecting the user’s browser language and automatically redirecting them to the corresponding language folder.

Demonstration:
Open a web browser and navigate to the main index.html file.
The script will redirect you to the English version of the website if your browser language is set to English.
If you change your preferred language in the browser settings, it will redirect you to the German version of the website.

Conclusion
I encountered this issue while building a website as a freelancer and couldn’t find a clear solution. This script is what I came up with, and it works well.
